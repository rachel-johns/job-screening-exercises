# job-screening-exercises

I am often asked for work samples, which I am not allowed to share due to non-disclosure agreements (NDAs)

This repository contains exercises that I have successfully completed for job interviews. 
My hope is that prospective employers will interpret this as realized aptitude in SQL, Python, and JavaScript.

Some techniques and skills to note are: recursive queries, HTTP APIs and REST APIs.
